## Hi there üëã

üìñ I'm a second year software engineering student at University of Minho, Braga,Portugal. <br/>
üß† I like to challenge myself to learn new skills and technologies. <br/>
üé≠ I've grown as a theather kid that really enjoys quality time with friends and community service. <br/>
ü§ù I'm a part of my student association at [@CeSIUM](https://cesium.di.uminho.pt/), currently as a co-director of DREM (Department of External Relations and Merchandising).<br/>
